# Jeeves - *Does things to make your Wayward life easier*

Please reach out with any issues or requested updates. This is my first and only mod for any game, so be kind.

My main goal with this mod is now to simply keep the features up to date, and add any new things that I feel help with general gameplay.

## Features
- [x] Close doors behind players (Original implementation from [HenryFBP](https://github.com/HenryFBP/wayward-close-da-door))
- [x] Manage items on ground like a container (Original implementation from [black-silence](https://github.com/black-silence/wayward-mod-pickuphelper))

## Mod Developer Stuff
- Wayward Modding Home - [Github](https://github.com/WaywardGame/waywardgame.github.io)

#### Update mod to latest game version:
1. Add `./Wayward/bin` to WindowsPath
2. Run `wayward +mod update .` from mod folder
